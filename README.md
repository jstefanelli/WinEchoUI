## Overview

![Version 0.1 Screenshot](https://jstefanelli.com/files/winechoui.png)

**WinEchoUI** is a program that allows you to duplicate the sound playing on a playback device and play it back on another with very low latency.

Internally it uses **[WinEcho](https://github.com/jstefanelli/WinEcho)**, a purpose-built library that uses the loopback functionality provided by the **Windows Audio Session API (WASAPI)**

## Installation
